Whenever you add a new libraries using the Arduino IDE, please copy all the library files from the temp or user folder in your machine to this folder.

Remember that these libraries are heavily volatile and downloading the wrong libraries or the wrong versiosn may throw the entire project out of synch.

Use exactly the same versions as in the initial checkout.

If you need to add any new versions, please test the entire system fully with your new library before you check in those changes.
