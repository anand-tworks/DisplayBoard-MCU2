Driver for TI\textquotesingle{}s A\+D\+S1\+X15\+: 12 and 16-\/bit Differential or Single-\/\+Ended A\+DC with P\+GA and Comparator

\subsection*{Info}

This family of A\+D\+Cs provide 4 single-\/ended or 2 differential channels. Each has a programmable gain amplifier from 2/3 up to 16x. Available in 12 or 16 bit versions\+:

The chip\textquotesingle{}s fairly small so it comes on a breakout board with ferrites to keep the A\+V\+DD and A\+G\+ND quiet. Interfacing is done via I2C. The address can be changed to one of four options (see the datasheet table 5) so you can have up to 4 A\+D\+S1x15\textquotesingle{}s connected on a single 2-\/wire I2C bus for 16 single ended inputs.
