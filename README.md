This folder contains all the projects for the P2 version of the Ventilator project. Several projects attempting variopus methods of accomplishing the project goals have been tried and all these folders contain the artefacts related to each one of those attempts.

Every folder is a submodule of the main BVM_P2 and contains its own README.md which explains the goal of the project, the tools used, steps to compile and run the project and artefacts like Assumptions, Testcases and deployment instructions

Best practices:

1. If you need to change any code in the Arduino modules, please follow the Arduino codding guidelines mentioned at https://courses.ideate.cmu.edu/16-223/f2016/text/resrc/coding-style-guide.html
2. After changing the code in any module, please regenerate the documentation.
3. Please document thoroughly, the set up and execution instruction and test procedures for your module
4. Before checking in any changes, please ensure that youget your code peer reviewed. The guidelines for the same are mentioned in the peer review guidelines
5. If you modify code due to any defect, please ensure that every line you cange is tracable to that particular change request.
6. After completing the modifications for any bug or new feature, please execute all the sanity test suite.
7. Before closing the code changes for a new feature or for a defect, please document the new test cases or modify old ones.
